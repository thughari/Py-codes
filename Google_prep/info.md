“Tell me about a time when you had to deliver a difficult message” “Describe a time you had to deal with a difficult customer and how you handled the situation” “Give me an example of a time when you took initiative” “Describe the process that you use to obtain new business from start to finish” “Tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership skills” “What management style suits you best?” “Please describe how you manage conflicting priorities” “Describe a situation when you were able to successfully influence another person” “When was the last time you were angry – what happened?” “Tell me about a time you improved a process” “Give an example of a situation where you solved a problem in a creative way”

You are given a string S of length N consisting of digits from ‘0’ to ‘9’. You need to partition the string in ‘K’ substrings such that each substring starts with an even digit and ends with an odd digit. Each substring must be of Length at least equal to ‘M’. Determine the total number of ways in which you can partition the string into ‘K’ substrings. Give answer modulo 1e9+7.
Sample: N=9, M=2, K=3, S=’454569421′

Implement a function to check if a binary tree is a valid binary search tree.Describe the differences between a process and a thread in a multitasking operating system.Write code to reverse a linked list.Explain the principles behind object-oriented programming and provide an example.Given an array of integers, find the two numbers that add up to a specific target.Describe how a hash table works and its time complexity for insertions and lookups.Implement a function to find the longest common subsequence of two strings.Explain the concept of time complexity and provide examples of algorithms with different time complexities.Write a program to determine if a string is a palindrome.Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using dynamic programming in algorithm design

1) Dynamic Programming
2) Super recursion (permutation, combination,...2^n, m^n, n!...etc. type of program. (NP hard, NP programs)
3) Probability related programs
4) Graphs: BFS/DFS are usually enough
5) All basic data structures from Arrays/Lists to circular queues, BSTs, Hash tables, B-Trees, and Red-Black trees, and all basic algorithms like sorting, binary search, median,...
6) Problem solving ability at a level similar to TopCoder Division 1, 250 points. If you can consistently solve these, then you are almost sure to get in with 2-weeks brush up.
7) Review all old interview questions in Glassdoor to get a feel. If you can solve 95% of them at home (including coding them up quickly and testing them out in a debugger + editor setup), you are in good shape.
8) Practice coding--write often and write a lot. If you can think of a solution, you should be able to code it easily...without much thought.
9) Very good to have for design interview: distributed systems knowledge and practical experience.
10) Good understanding of basic discrete math, computer architecture, basic math.
11) Coursera courses and assignments give a lot of what you need to know.
12) Note that all the above except the first 2 are useful in "real life" programming too!

Interview 1:
Graph related question and super recursion

Interview 2:
Design discussion involving a distributed system with writes/reads going on at different sites in parallel.

Interview 3:
Array and Tree related questions

Interview 4:
Designing a simple class to do something. Not hard, but not easy either. You need to know basic data structures very well to consider different designs and trade-offs.

Interview 5:
Dynamic programming,
Computer architecture and low level perf. enhancement question which requires knowledge of Trees, binary search, etc.
